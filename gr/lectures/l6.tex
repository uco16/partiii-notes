\begin{example}[one-form on $\mathbb{R}^3$]
  Consider the 1-form $\omega = \omega_\mu(x) dx^\mu$. Then
  \begin{equation}
    (d\omega)_{\mu \nu} = \partial_\mu \omega_\nu - \partial_\nu \omega_\mu \quad \text{or} \quad
    d\omega = \frac{1}{2} (\partial_\mu \omega_\nu - \partial_\nu \omega_\mu) dx^\mu \wedge dx^\nu.
  \end{equation}
  On $\mathbb{R}^3$, we have
  \begin{equation}
    d\omega = (\partial_1 \omega_2 - \partial_2 \omega_1) dx^1 \wedge dx^2
    + (\partial_2 \omega_3 - \partial_3 \omega_2) dx^2 \wedge dx^3 +
    (\partial_3 \omega_1 - \partial_1 \omega_3) dx^3 \wedge dx^1.
  \end{equation}
  Here we have used the property of the wedge product that $dx^i \wedge dx^i = 0$.
  These three terms are the components of the curl $\curl \boldsymbol \omega$.
  The correct way to think about the curl is as an exterior derivative as a one-form, which coincidentally has three components as well.
\end{example}

\begin{example}[two form on $\mathbb{R}^3$]
  Consider $B \in \Lambda^2(\mathbb{R}^3)$ with
  \begin{equation}
    B = B_1(x) dx^2 \wedge dx^3 +B_2(x) dx^3 \wedge dx^1 + B_3(x) dx^1 \wedge dx^2.
  \end{equation}
  Taking the exterior derivative of this two-form, we get a three form. However, this is a top-form in $\mathbb{R}^3$, so we only have once component.
  \begin{equation}
    dB = (\partial_1 B_1 + \partial_2 B_2 + \partial_3 B_3) dx^1 \wedge dx^2 \wedge dx^3.
  \end{equation}
  We have seen this before as well. These are the components of the divergence $\div \vb B$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  In electromagnetism, the gauge field $A^\mu$ should be thought of as a one-form $A \in \Lambda^1(\mathbb{R}^4)$.
  In components, this is $A = A_\mu dx^\mu$.
  Taking the exterior derivative we get 
  \begin{equation}
    F = dA = F_{\mu\nu} dx^\mu \wedge dx^\nu = \frac{1}{2} (\partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu) dx^\mu \wedge dx^\nu.
  \end{equation}
  Gauge transformations act as $A \to A + d\alpha$, where $\alpha \in \Lambda^0(\mathcal{M}) = C^\infty(\mathcal{M})$.
  Under this transformation, the field strength is invariant since
  \begin{equation}
    F = dA \to d(A + d\alpha) = dA.
  \end{equation}
  Moreover, since $F = dA$ is exact, we have $dF = d^2A = 0$. This is the \emph{Bianchi identity}, which is equivalent to two of the Maxwell equations.
  We need one more ingredient to write the other two Maxwell equations in terms of differential forms.
\end{example}

\section{Integration on Manifolds}%
\label{sec:integration}

On a manifold, we integrate with the use of differential forms.
\begin{definition}[volume form]
  A \emph{volume form} $v$, also called an \emph{orientation}, is a nowhere-vanishing top-form.
  Locally, it can be written as
  \begin{equation}
    v = v(x)\; dx^1 \wedge dx^2 \wedge \dots \wedge dx^\mu ,
  \end{equation}
  with $v(x) \neq 0$ everywhere.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[]
  If a volume form exists, $\mathcal{M}$ is said to be \emph{orientable}.
\end{definition}
\begin{leftbar}
  \begin{remark}
    There are a bunch of subtleties here; not all manifolds are orientable, e.g.~the Möbius strip, or real projective space $\mathbb{RP}^{2n}$.
    However, these are not useful in GR; which is why we will brush these subtleties under the carpet.
  \end{remark}
\end{leftbar}
\begin{definition}[integration]
  Given a volume form, we can integrate any function $f \in C^\infty(\mathcal{M})$ over $\mathcal{M}$.
  To do this, we map it to $\mathbb{R}$ via a chart, and then integrate over $\mathbb{R}^n$ as we would usually do.
  In a coordinate patch $\mathcal{O} \subset \mathcal{M}$, we have
  \begin{equation}
    \int_{\mathcal{O}} fv \coloneqq \int_{U} f(x) v(x) dx^1 \dots dx^\mu .
  \end{equation}
  We then sum over patches $\mathcal{O}$ to integrate over $\mathcal{M}$.
\end{definition}
\begin{leftbar}
  \begin{remark}
    In the language of integration, the volume form is the \emph{measure}, which tells us how to weight functions on the manifold. This is because we have no notion of distance between points on the manifold without it.
  \end{remark}
\end{leftbar}

\begin{definition}[submanifold]
  A manifold $\Sigma$ of dimension $k < n$ is a \emph{submanifold} of $\mathcal{M}$ if there exists a bijection $\phi\colon \Sigma \to \mathcal{M}$, which embeds $\Sigma$ into $\mathcal{M}$, such that $\phi_*\colon T_p(\Sigma) \to T_p(\mathcal{M})$ is also a bijection.
\end{definition}
These definitions make sure that everything is nice and smooth.
We can then integrate any $\omega \in \Lambda^k(\mathcal{M})$ over the submanifold $\Sigma$ by
\begin{equation}
  \int_{\phi(\Sigma)} \omega = \int_{\Sigma} \phi^* \omega,
\end{equation}
where $\omega^*$ is the pull-back.

\begin{example}[]
  Let $\sigma$ be a map $\sigma \colon C \subset \mathbb{R} \to \mathcal{M}$. This defines a non-intersecting curve in $\mathcal{M}$, parametrised by $\tau$. Then, if $A \in \Lambda^1(\mathcal{M})$, in coordinates $x^\mu$, the integral is
  \begin{equation}
    \int_{\sigma(C)} A = \int_{C}\sigma^* A = \int \dd{\tau} A_\mu (x) \dv{x^\mu}{\tau}.
  \end{equation}
  The action in Minkowski space is obtained by pulling back the one-form in Minkowski space $\mathbb{M}^4$ to the real line, and then integrating over this line.
\end{example}

\begin{theorem}[Stokes' Theorem]
  Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a manifold with boundary $\partial M$, as illustrated in \ref{fig:mfdwboundary}.
  If $\omega \in \Lambda^{n-1}(\mathcal{M})$, then
  \begin{equation}
    \int_{\mathcal{M}} d\omega = \int_{\partial \mathcal{M}} \omega.
  \end{equation}
\end{theorem}

\begin{example}[]
  Let $\mathcal{M}$ be the one-dimensional interval $I$ with $x \in [a, b]$. The zero-form $\omega(x)$ is a function, and $d\omega = \dv{\omega}{x} dx$ is a one-form.
  Stokes' theorem says that
  \begin{equation}
    \int_{\mathcal{M}} d\omega = \int_{a}^{b} \dv{\omega}{x} \dd[]{x} \quad \text{and} \quad 
    \int_{\partial \mathcal{M}} \omega = \omega(b) - \omega(a)
  \end{equation}
  where the minus sign is related to the subtleties at the boundary, which we have previously swept under the carpet.
  This is the \emph{fundamental theorem of calculus}.
\end{example}

\begin{example}[]
  Let $\mathcal{M} \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ and $\omega \in \Lambda^1(\mathcal{M})$. Then
  \begin{align}
    \int_{\mathcal{M}} d\omega &= \int_{\mathcal{M}} \left( \pdv{\omega_2}{x^1} - \pdv{\omega_1}{x^2} \right) dx^1 \wedge dx^2 \\
    \text{ and } \quad \int_{\partial \mathcal{M}} \omega &= \int_{\partial \mathcal{M}} \omega_1 dx^1 + \omega_2 dx^2.
  \end{align}
  The equality between left and right hand sides is \emph{Green's theorem} in the plane.
\end{example}

\begin{example}[]
  Let $\mathcal{M} \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ and $\omega \in \Lambda^2 (\mathcal{M})$. Then 
  \begin{align}
    \int_{\mathcal{M}} d\omega &= \int dx^1 dx^2 dx^3 \left( \partial_1 \omega_1 + \partial_2 \omega_2 + \partial_3 \omega_3 \right) \\
    \text{and} \quad \int_{\partial \mathcal{M}} \omega &= \int_{\partial \mathcal{M}} \omega_1 dx^2 dx^3 + \omega_2 dx^3 dx^1 + \omega_3 dx^1 dx^2.
  \end{align}
  The equality between these two sides is \emph{Gauss' divergence theorem}.
\end{example}
