# Part III Lecture Notes
Lecture notes for my Part III course notes of 2019-2020.

## Credit where credit is due...
I am writing up these lecture notes during my Part III courses entirely for my own revision, and am posting them here so that others may use them too if they wish.
In particular, this means that I am simply writing down what I see and hear during lectures and do not in any way deserve credit for the scientific contents of these notes; those contents (apart from my naive comments, questions, and additions) are entirely due to the lectureres of the respective courses.
On that note however, I am most definitely responsible for all the erorrs, which certainly found their way ubiqutously into these notes.  Many thanks to Roman for pointing out a number of typos. If you find any errors, please feel free to drop me a quick email at 'uco21@cam.ac.uk' or simply open up a pull request.
