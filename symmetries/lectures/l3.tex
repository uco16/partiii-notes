\section{Embedded Submanifolds}%
\label{sec:embedded submanifolds}

We can define properties of manifold in an intrinsic way. However, for some of these properties it is significantly easier to define manifolds as subspaces embedded in real space.
In general, we can achieve this if we write
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{M} = \left\{ \vb{x} \in \mathbb{R}^m \mid \mathcal{F}_\alpha(\vb{x}) = 0 \right\}
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{F}_\alpha: \mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}$, with $\alpha = 1, \cdots, l$ is a smooth map.

\begin{theorem}[Embedding Theorem]
$\mathcal{M}$ is a manifold of dimension $D = m-l$ if and only if the Jacobian matrix
\begin{equation}
  (\mathcal{J})_{\alpha, i} = \pdv{\mathcal{F}_\alpha}{x_i}
\end{equation}
has maximal rank $l$ everywhere on the manifold $\mathcal{M}$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{example}[$S^2$]
We can realise the two-sphere $S^2$ as a manifold embedded in three dimensional Euclidean space
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{M} = \left\{\vb{x} \in \mathbb{R}^3 \mid \abs{\vb{x}} = R \right\}
\end{equation}
The solution space of $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 -R^2 = F$ defines a manifold.
In this case, the Jacobian 
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{J} = \left( \pdv{\mathcal{F}}{x}, \pdv{\mathcal{F}}{y}, \pdv{\mathcal{F}}{z}\right) = 2(x, y, z)
\end{equation}
has rank 1 except at $x = y = z = 0$, but that point is not on the manifold, so that is allowed by the theorem.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}[connected]
  A manifold is said to be \emph{connected} if there is a smooth path between any two paths on the manifold.
\end{definition} 

%F1

\begin{definition}[simply connected]
  A manifold is said to be \emph{simply connected} if all loops are ``trivial'', in the sense that they can be continuously be contracted to a point.
\end{definition}

%F2

\begin{example}[]
The spherical surface $S^2$ is simply connected, while the torus $T^2$ is not.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}[compact]
  A manifold is said to be a \emph{compact space} if any \emph{closed} and \emph{bounded} subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is \emph{compact}.
\end{definition}

%F3

\begin{example}[]
The sphere is a compact space, while the hyperboloid is not.
\end{example}

\section{Matrix Lie Groups}%
\label{sec:matrix_lie_groups}

Matrix multiplication is \emph{closed} and \emph{associative} and there exists a unit element
\begin{equation}
  e = 1_n \in \text{Mat}_n(F).
\end{equation}
Here, $F$ is some field. We will mostly be working with $F = \mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$.
However, the set of matrices $\text{Mat}_n(F)$ is not a group under matrix multiplication since not all matrices are \emph{invertible}.

\begin{definition}[general linear group]
The general linear group of dimension $n$ is the set of matrices with non-vanishing determinant
\begin{equation}
  GL(n, F) = \left\{ M \in \text{Mat}_n(F) \mid \text{det}M \neq 0 \right\}
\end{equation}
guaranteeing invertibility.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[special linear group]
The special linear group has unit determinant
\begin{equation}
  SL(n, F) = \left\{ M \in GL(n, F) \mid \text{det}; = 1 \right\}
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

These are enough to guarantee that these are groups. In particular, the closure property follows from
\begin{equation}
  \det(M_1 M_2) = \det(M_1) \det(M_2) \qquad \forall M_1, M_2 \in \text{Mat}_n(F).
\end{equation}

This is connected to the embedding theorem in the following way.
Taking $SL(n, \mathbb{R})$ we apply the embedding theorem with $m = n^2$. The number of constraints is $l = 1$ due to the determinant being constraint to unity:
\begin{equation}
  F_1(M) = \det M - 1
\end{equation}

To apply the embedding theorem we have to calculate the Jacobian. 
It is useful to recall the definition of a minor:
\begin{definition}[minor]
  Let $M \in \text{Mat}_n(\mathbb{R})$ be an $n \times n$ matrix with real entries. We define the \emph{minor} $\hat M^{(ij)}$ of each element of the matrix as the $(n-1) \times (n-1)$ matrix with $i$th row and $j$th column deleted.
\end{definition}
Using this definition, we can differentiate as follows
\begin{equation}
  \pdv{F}{M_{ij}} = \pm \det(\hat M^{(ij)}).
\end{equation}
$\pdv{F}{M_{ij}}$ has rank 1, unless all the determinants of the minors vanish.
This is equivalent to the determinant of the matrix vanishing
\begin{equation}
  \det(\hat M^{(ij)}) = 0 \iff \det(M) = 0 \neq 1
\end{equation}

This shows that $SL(n, \mathbb{R})$ is a smooth manifold of dimension $n^2 - 1$.
We could do this with $SL(n, \mathbb{C})$ by splitting the coordinates and then the detminant condition in its real and imaginary parts. For the general linear groups, we define them by removing a condition.

\begin{exercise}
  Complete the proof that $SL(n, \mathbb{R})$ is a Lie group. For this, you have to convince yourself that matrix multiplication, considered element by element, provides a smooth map.
\end{exercise}

This gives us four families of matrix Lie groups.
We have established that
\begin{equation}
  \text{dim}(SL(n, \mathbb{R})) = n^2 - 1.
\end{equation}
A similar argument allows us to find that
\begin{equation}
  \text{dim}(SL(n, \mathbb{C})) = 2n^2 - 2.
\end{equation}
Moreover, for the general linear group we can find that
\begin{equation}
  \text{dim}(GL(n, \mathbb{R})) = n^2 \qquad \text{dim}(GL(2, \mathbb{C})) = 2n^2.
\end{equation}

\begin{definition}[submanifold]
  A sub manifold is a subspace of a manifold that is also a manifold.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Lie subgroup]
  A \emph{Lie subgroup} is a subset of a Lie group which is also a Lie group.
\end{definition}

%\subsection{Subgroup of $GL(N, \mathbb{R})$}%
%\label{sub:subgroup_of_gl_n_r_}

\begin{definition}[orthogonal groups]
  The \emph{orthogonal groups} are defined to be those elements of the general linear groups which satisfy the orthogonality condition
  \begin{equation}
    O(n) = \left\{ M \in GL(n, \mathbb{R}) \mid M M^T = 1_n \right\}.
  \end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[orthogonal transformations]
Orthogonal transformations are of the form
\begin{equation}
  \vb{v} \in \mathbb{R}^n \to \vb{v}' = M \cdot \vb{v} \in \mathbb{R}^n
\end{equation}
  where $M \in O(n)$ is an orthogonal matrix.
\end{definition}

Orthogonal transformations can be thought of as linear transformations which preserve the length of vectors since
\begin{equation}
  \abs{\vb{b}'} = \vb{v}'^T \cdot \vb{v}' = \vb{v} \cdot M^T M \cdot \vb{v} = \vb{v}^T \cdot \vb{v} = \abs{\vb{v}}^2.
\end{equation}

If we have an orthogonal real matrix, we have
\begin{equation}
  \det(M M^T) = \det(M)^2 = 1,
\end{equation}
so its determinant is $\det(M) = \pm 1$.

From this, by continuity, we can tell that $O(n)$ is not a connected manifold. Indeed, $O(n)$ must have 2 \emph{connected components}. Moreover, only one of these can contain the identity element.
As such, we can consider the space which only includes the connected components of the identity:
\begin{definition}[special orthogonal group]
\begin{equation}
  SO(n) = \left\{ M \in O(n) \mid \det(M) = 1 \right\}
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

How do we distinguish between matrices which have $\det(M) = \pm 1$?
Given a frame $\left\{ \vb{v}_1, \cdots, \vb{v}_n \right\}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and an orthogonal transformation
\begin{equation}
  \vb{v}_a \in \mathbb{R}^n \to \vb{v}_a' = M \cdot \vb{v}_a \in \mathbb{R}^n
\end{equation}
with $M \in O(n)$, preserves the \emph{orientation} of a frame, i.e.~the sign of the volume element
\begin{equation}
  \Omega = \varepsilon^{i_1, \ldots, i_n} v_1^{i_1}v_2^{i_2} \cdots v_n^{i_n},
\end{equation}
where $\varepsilon$ is the $n$-dimensional alternating tensor, only if $M \in SO(n)$.
Elements of $SO(n)$ correspond to \emph{rotations}, whereas elements of $O(n)$ with $\det(M) = -1$ correspond to some mixture of \emph{rotation} and \emph{reflection}.

\begin{exercise}
  Use the embedding theorem to check that $O(n)$ is a manifold and that its dimension is
  \begin{equation}
    \text{dim}(O(n)) = \text{dim} SO(n) = \frac{1}{2}n(n-1).
  \end{equation}
  Remember to show that the Jacobian matrix has maximal rank.
\end{exercise}
